Before running program (./build/prog):
    stty -icanon -echo min 0 time 0

Explanation:
    -icanon → every char delivered immediately
    -echo → don't echo chars
    min 0 time 0 → read() returns immediately
    (required for non-blocking with canonical mode off)

Restore shell afterwards:
    stty sane
